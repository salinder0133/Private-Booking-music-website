🚀 Live Demo: Click Here to Experience the Site

📝 About The Project
This project is a futuristic, Cyberpunk-themed music portfolio website designed to simulate a high-end artist booking platform. It focuses on delivering an immersive visual and audio experience using advanced frontend techniques.

The design is built around Glassmorphism (frosted glass effect) and Neon Aesthetics, creating a deep-space vibe. Unlike standard websites, this project features a custom-built audio engine and 3D interactive elements that respond to user movement, making the interface feel alive.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This is a frontend portfolio project created for demonstration purposes. It is not connected to any real artist management service, and no actual payments or bookings are processed.

✨ Key Features
1. 🎨 Immersive Cyberpunk UI
Neon Atmosphere: A deep space background with floating ambient lights in Cyan and Pink to set the mood.

Glassmorphism Design: Cards and containers use a translucent "frosted glass" effect with semi-transparent borders.

Glowing Elements: Text and boxes feature neon glow effects, simulating a futuristic dashboard.

2. 🎧 Custom Audio Engine
Smart Playlist System: A fully functional music player built from scratch using JavaScript.

Visualizers: Animated bars that simulate music beats and rhythm in real-time.

Advanced Controls: Includes Play/Pause, Next/Previous track, and a smooth seeking slider to jump to any part of the song.

Auto-Flow: The player automatically starts the next track once the current one finishes.

3. 🧊 3D Holographic Interactions
Tilt Effect: Elements on the screen move in 3D space following the user's mouse cursor, creating a holographic depth effect.

Realistic Physics: The interface adjusts perspective dynamically, making the cards feel like physical objects floating in space.

Touch Optimization: The 3D logic automatically adjusts for mobile devices to ensure smooth performance on touch screens.

4. 📱 Fully Responsive & Mobile-First
Adaptive Layouts: The design uses fluid grids to look perfect on everything from large desktop monitors to small mobile phones.

Mobile Menu: A custom-animated hamburger menu ensures easy navigation on smaller screens.

Touch-Friendly: Buttons and interactive areas are optimized for touch, ensuring a frustration-free experience on mobile.
